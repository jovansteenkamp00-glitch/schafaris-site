IMPORTANT: Add your image files into the 'images' folder (inside the zip) BEFORE publishing.
Required image filenames (case-sensitive):
  - images/logo.jpg      -> your provided logo (recommended 500x200 or similar)
  - images/beef.jpg
  - images/lamb.jpg
  - images/chicken.jpg
  - images/sausages.jpg

You already said you have the photos named beef, chicken, lamb, sausages â€” rename/copy them into the images folder.
Then upload the entire folder to GitHub (or Netlify/Vercel) as instructed earlier.
